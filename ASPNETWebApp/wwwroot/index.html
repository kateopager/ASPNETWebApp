        A lot of IS concepts feel easy to understand, but then  when I go to write a program or complete a homework task
        I often feel completely lost. I'm hoping that this class will help with my overall understanding of programs and improve my programmer way of thinking.
        I think that this class will also challenge me and help improve my overall problem solving skills. Sometimes I get frustrated with code and want to quit, but 
        this class will encourage me to keep trying and I'm eager to see all the new hard and soft skills that will come because of the struggle of it.
